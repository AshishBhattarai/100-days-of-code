# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created WindowManager class to handle engine's window&events and created a Map class which loades map from a file to vector of string then into vector of tiles.

**Thoughts:** I'll create player entity next

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a Vec2 class for 2D vectors & created rough sketch of Player class(on notebook)

**Thoughts:** I think i should re implement my WindowManager class or remove WidowManager class

### Day 2: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made WindowManager class static, created player entity & InputHandler class. You can move player around the screen;

**Thoughts:** I sloved lots of problem related to WindowManager class today and created player entity. Next is physics codes.

### Day 3: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a rough sketch fo collision system.

**Thoughts:** I think i should sketch out other physics codes too and implement them along with the collision system.

### Day 6: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed input bugs, Improved jump & gravity simulation AND implemented camera

**Thoughts:** Today i did a lot of stuffs. Fixed my buggy jump & gravity + implemented camera. Next i'll	 do some optimization & add textures to the engine.
